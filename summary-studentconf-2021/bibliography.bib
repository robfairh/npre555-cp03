	abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or ﬁne mesh applications as pin by pin neutron ﬂux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a ﬁnite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly conﬁgurations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a comprehensive study on the feasibility of advanced reactor core analyses within the framework of pin-by-pin multigroup transport calculations using a prototype of the object-oriented parallel core calculation code SCOPE. The SCOPE code enables the coupling of the diffusion theory method and the SPN transport theory method. The formulation of the method coupling and its verifications with benchmarks are presented. Quantitative estimation of the pin-cell homogenization effects within the octant core geometry of a three-loop-type pressurized water reactor (PWR) was performed. Comparisons between results by heterogeneous and homogeneous calculations revealed the effects on pin-cell homogenization in large-scale geometry. In order to preserve the neutronic property in the heterogeneous calculation within the framework of pin-cell homogenized pin-by-pin calculations, the applicability of the homogenized cross section corrected by the superhomogénéisation SPH method was studied. It was found that the pin-by-pin nine-group calculation by the SP3 transport theory method with the SPH-corrected cross sections gave good accuracy for the pin power distribution approximately {\textless}1\% of the root-mean-square error. The calculation accuracy of the transport calculation and the effectiveness of the method coupling were also demonstrated through analyses of the initial core of an identical three-loop-type PWR. With fine-grained parallelism, the identical convergence property was obtained regardless of the number of processors. Parallel performance was almost scalable up to eight processors, 93\% with eight processors in three-dimensional nine-group fine-mesh transport calculations with meshes of 180 × 180 × 30.},

	abstract = {It is demonstrated that the simplified PN equations are a leading order asymptotic limit of the transport equation. This limit is one of locally nearly planar transport involving scattering which is highly peaked in the forward direction. This asymptotic equivalence is valid in full generality, in that it allows time-dependent transport in a heterogeneous medium. It is also shown that the simplified PN equations can be derived variationally, making use of certain trial functions in a variational characterization of the even-parity transport equation. In this case, however, there appears to be an inherent restriction to time-independent transport in a homogeneous medium.},

	abstract = {Moltres is a new physics application for modeling coupled physics in ﬂuid-fuelled, molten salt reactors. This paper describes its neutronics model, thermal hydraulics model, and their coupling in the MOOSE framework. Neutron and precursor equations are implemented using an action system that allows use of an arbitrary number of groups with no change in the input card. Results for many-channel conﬁgurations in 2D-axisymmetric and 3D coordinates are presented and compared against other coupled models as well as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of nuclear reactors is a key technology in the quest for improvements in efﬁciency, safety, and reliability of both existing and future reactor designs. Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-speciﬁc applications, all built on the same software framework, are efﬁciently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a ﬂexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simpliﬁed Westinghouse AP-1000 conﬁguration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shufﬂe.},

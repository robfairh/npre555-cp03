	abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or ﬁne mesh applications as pin by pin neutron ﬂux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a ﬁnite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly conﬁgurations.},

The $P_N$ method \cite{davidson_neutron_1957} discretizes the transport equation by expanding the angular dependence of the neutron flux in Legendre polynomials.
The method leads to an approximation when the expansion considers only up to order $N$ polynomials.


If $N \rightarrow \infty$, the solution tends to the exact transport solution.
In three-dimensional geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations grows like $(N+1)^2$.
In one-dimensional Cartesian geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations in $(N+1)$.


Gelbard proposed the $SP_N$ approximation by replacing the second derivatives in the one-dimensional Cartesian $P_N$ equations with three-dimensional Laplacian operators.

The $SP_N$ approximation considerably reduces the number of equations conserving a reasonable accuracy.

The disadvantages of the $SP_N$ approximation is that the solution does not usually converge to the true transport solution as $N \rightarrow \infty$.



Several studies reported an increased accuracy over the diffusion method.

They showed that these equations are higher-order asymptotic solutions of the transport equation in a physical regime in which diffusion theory is the leading-order approximation.....

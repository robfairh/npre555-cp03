The $P_N$ method \cite{davidson_neutron_1957} discretizes the transport equation by expanding the angular dependence of the neutron flux in Legendre polynomials.
The method leads to an approximation when the expansion considers only up to order $N$ polynomials.


If $N \rightarrow \infty$, the solution tends to the exact transport solution.
In three-dimensional geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations grows like $(N+1)^2$.
In one-dimensional Cartesian geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations in $(N+1)$.


Gelbard proposed the $SP_N$ approximation by replacing the second derivatives in the one-dimensional planar $P_N$ equations with three-dimensional Laplacian operators.

This approximation reduces the number of equations considerably conserving a reasonable accuracy.

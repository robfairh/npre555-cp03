    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2-D test case: suggest $SP_3$ equations implementation is correct
        \item 1-D test cases: solutions are very similar to diffusion solution
        \item $SP_N$ have a higher computational expense than diffusion
        \item further studies are necessary to conclude anything on the accuracy
        \item In general, $SP_N$ are more accurate than diffusion \cite{brantley_simplifiedP3_2000}
        \item Less computational expense than $S_N$ or $P_N$
        \item the study cases do not show an increased accuracy over diffusion
    \end{itemize}

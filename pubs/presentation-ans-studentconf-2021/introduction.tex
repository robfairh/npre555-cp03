  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement the $SP_3$ equations in a MOOSE-based application.
    \item Verify the implementation by conducting the following exercises:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item One-group, two-dimensional eigenvalue problem.
        \item C5 MOX Benchmark.

\frametitle{Motivation}
  
  Why a neutronics solver?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Neutronics provide information on the power distribution.
    \item Crucial role in the thermal-fluids behavior of a reactor.
    \item Multi-physics simulations for safety assessment.
  \end{itemize}

  Why the $SP_3$ equations?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fewer equations than $P_3$.
    \item Reduces the computational expense.
    \item Conserves a reasonable accuracy.
    \item More accurate solution than diffusion approximation.
  \end{itemize}
  
  Why MOOSE?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Partial differential equations describe the reactor physics.
    \item Computational framework for solving coupled equation systems.
    \item Open-source.
    \item Facilitates coupling between various applications targeting different phenomena.
  \end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented the kernels to solve the steady-state $SP_3$ equations in a MOOSE-based application.
        \item Conducted two exercises whose reference results were known.
		\item Eigenvalue for the first exercise within 12 pcm.
		\item Eigenvalues for the second exercise within 145 pcm.
		\item Transport correction is necessary when the scattering higher moments are unknown.
		\item Calculated pin power values within 2\% difference in the MOX fuel assembly.
        \item Future work may develop new applications or integrate this application to other physics solvers.

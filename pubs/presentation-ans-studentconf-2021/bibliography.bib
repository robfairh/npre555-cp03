	abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or ﬁne mesh applications as pin by pin neutron ﬂux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a ﬁnite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly conﬁgurations.},

The authors stress throughout the very close interplay between the nuclear analysis of a reactor core and those nonnuclear aspects of core analysis, such as thermal-hydraulics or materials studies, which play a major role in determining a reactor design.},

	abstract = {Systems of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations often arise in simulation of nuclear processes. MOOSE: Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment, a parallel computational framework targeted at solving these systems, is presented. As opposed to traditional data-ﬂow oriented computational frameworks, MOOSE is founded on the mathematical principle of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solution methods. Utilizing the mathematical structure present in JFNK, physics are modularized into “Kernels” allowing for rapid production of new simulation tools. In addition, systems are solved fully coupled and fully implicit employing physics based preconditioning which allows for great ﬂexibility even with large variance in time scales. A summary of the mathematics, an inspection of the structure of MOOSE, and several representative solutions from applications built on the framework are presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper we describe the libMesh (http://libmesh.sourceforge.net)framework for parallel adaptive ﬁnite element applications. libMesh is an open-source software library that has been developed to facilitate serial and parallel simulation of multiscale, multiphysics applications using adaptive mesh reﬁnement and coarsening strategies. The main software development is being carried out in the CFDLab (http://cfdlab.ae.utexas.edu) at the University of Texas, but as with other open-source software projects; contributions are being made elsewhere in the US and abroad. The main goals of this article are: (1) to provide a basic reference source that describes libMesh and the underlying philosophy and software design approach; (2) to give sufﬁcient detail and references on the adaptive mesh reﬁnement and coarsening (AMR/ C) scheme for applications analysts and developers; and (3) to describe the parallel implementation and data structures with supporting discussion of domain decomposition, message passing, and details related to dynamic repartitioning for parallel AMR/C. Other aspects related to C++ programming paradigms, reusability for diverse applications, adaptive modeling, physics-independent error indicators, and similar concepts are brieﬂy discussed. Finally, results from some applications using the library are presented and areas of future research are discussed.},

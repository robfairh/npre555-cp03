	abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or ﬁne mesh applications as pin by pin neutron ﬂux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a ﬁnite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly conﬁgurations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a comprehensive study on the feasibility of advanced reactor core analyses within the framework of pin-by-pin multigroup transport calculations using a prototype of the object-oriented parallel core calculation code SCOPE. The SCOPE code enables the coupling of the diffusion theory method and the SPN transport theory method. The formulation of the method coupling and its verifications with benchmarks are presented. Quantitative estimation of the pin-cell homogenization effects within the octant core geometry of a three-loop-type pressurized water reactor (PWR) was performed. Comparisons between results by heterogeneous and homogeneous calculations revealed the effects on pin-cell homogenization in large-scale geometry. In order to preserve the neutronic property in the heterogeneous calculation within the framework of pin-cell homogenized pin-by-pin calculations, the applicability of the homogenized cross section corrected by the superhomogénéisation SPH method was studied. It was found that the pin-by-pin nine-group calculation by the SP3 transport theory method with the SPH-corrected cross sections gave good accuracy for the pin power distribution approximately {\textless}1\% of the root-mean-square error. The calculation accuracy of the transport calculation and the effectiveness of the method coupling were also demonstrated through analyses of the initial core of an identical three-loop-type PWR. With fine-grained parallelism, the identical convergence property was obtained regardless of the number of processors. Parallel performance was almost scalable up to eight processors, 93\% with eight processors in three-dimensional nine-group fine-mesh transport calculations with meshes of 180 × 180 × 30.},

	abstract = {This paper aims at analysing the potential of pin-by-pin SP n calculations to compute the neutronic flux in PWR cores as an alternative to the diffusion approximation. As far as pin-by-pin calculations are concerned, a SPH equivalence is used to preserve the reactions rates. The use of SPH equivalence is a common pratice in core diffusion calculations. In this paper, a methodology to generalize the equivalence procedure in the SP n equations context is presented. In order to verify and validate the equivalence procedure, SP n calculations are compared to 2D transport reference results obtained with the APOLL02 code. The validation cases consist in 3x3 analytical assembly colorsets involving burn-up heterogeneities, UOX/MOX interfaces, and control rods. Considering various energy discretizations (up to 26 groups) and flux development orders (up to 7) for the SP n equations, results show that 26-group SP 3 calculations are very close to the transport reference (with pin production rates discrepancies {\textless} 1\%). This proves the high interest of pin-by-pin SP n calculations as an industrial reference when relying on 26 energy groups combined with SP 3 flux development order. Additionally, the SP n results are compared to diffusion pin-by-pin calculations, in order to evaluate the potential benefit of using a SP n solver as an alternative to diffusion. Discrepancies on pin-production rates are less than 1.6\% for 6-group SP 3 calculations against 3.2\% for 2-group diffusion calculations. This shows that SP n solvers may be considered as an alternative to multigroup diffusion.},

As the core time dependent analysis necessitates the solution of an eigenvalue problem for an initial condition, this work is hence devoted to development and veriﬁcation of the proposed static SP3-ACMFD solver. A 3D multi-group static diffusion solver is also developed as a byproduct of this work to assess the improvement achieved using the SP3 technique. Static results are then compared against transport benchmarks to assess the proximity of SP3-ACMFD solutions to their full transport peers. Results prove that the approach can be considered as an acceptable interim approximation with outputs superior to the diffusion method, close to the transport results, and with the computational costs less than the full transport approach. The work would be further generalized to time dependent solutions in Part II.},

	abstract = {The SP3 approximation of the neutron transport equation allows improving the accuracy for both static and transient simulations for reactor core analysis compared with the neutron diffusion theory. Besides, the SP3 calculation costs are much less than higher order transport methods (SN or PN). Another advantage of the SP3 approximation is a similar structure of equations that is used in the diffusion method. Therefore, there is no difficulty to implement the SP
3 solution option to the multi-group neutron diffusion codes. In this work, the application of the SP3 methodology based on solution of the λ- and α-spectral problems has been tested for the IAEA-2D and PWR reactor benchmark tests.
The FEM is chosen to achieve the 3D geometrical generality, using GMSH as a generic mesh generator. The results calculated with the diffusion and SP3 methods are compared with the reference transport calculation results. It was found for the HWR reactor test that some eigenvalues are complex when calculating using both diffusion and SP3 options.},

	abstract = {An important reactor physics analysis technique involves use of a cell-spectrum code to generate few-group parameters for a diffusion theory code that is then used to compute power distributions. In this technique, strong local absorbers are dealt with by using effective few-group parameters. There remain, however, transport effects that are not accurately treated by the diffusion theory. The diffusion calculations are usually applied in two space dimensions, and here ray effects make it difficult to supplement the diffusion calculations by discrete ordinates. P/sub N/ methods, particularly when certain terms are ignored, appear to be more promising. In particular, simplified P3 (SP3) methods have been successfully applied to nodal calculations and to the fast energy group of the widely used diffusions codes PDQ and Exterminator. Here the authors examine the accuracy and efficiency of various numerical implementations of the P3 and simplified P3 methods (keeping certain terms) in supplementing diffusion calculations. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) diffusion code DIFXYRZ has been modified to provide these P3 calculations as well as the normal diffusion calculations. The DIFXYRZ code is mesh-point centered, as in PDQ, and the added P3 terms use the same differencing technique. Results are described for a typical reactor and for well-known transport test problems. These calculations were run on IBM-3081D, VAX-11/750, and Leading Edge D-PC computers.},

The new theory does not need the assumption of locally 1D behavior near a surface. The resulting interface and the boundary conditions, different from the ad hoc conditions conventionally assumed, contain higher order derivatives of the solution functions to the SPN equations.This new SPN theory was presented in the previous paper for the mono-energetic case with generic isotropic neutron sources in piecewise homogeneous regions. In this sequel paper the theory is generalized to the generic case of multi-energy groups including anisotropic neutron sources as well. Although the multigroup extension is straightforward, the inclusion of anisotropic sources poses subtle problems. To be valid for any arbitrary linear anisotropic external source a Generalized SP3 (GSP3) theory is proposed. GSP3 clariﬁes how to decompose a linearly anisotropic source via Helmholtz decomposition so that its irrotational component can be properly incorporated into SP3. GSP3 is more accurate than SP3. It includes two additional diffusion type equations decoupled from the two original SP3 equations, with in total eight instead of four interface or boundary conditions. The GSP3 equations are all of diffusion type and the additional interface and boundary conditions are manageable for practical engineering applications.},

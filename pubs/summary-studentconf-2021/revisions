To do:

* Re-order introduction to improve the flow of ideas


Doing

* Motivate SP3 implementation a little more strongly
	- Am I targeting a particular problem
	- Will this primarily be useful for comparison with other methods

* Clarify that the method only solves SPN for N=3


Done

* Remove 'the' from 'within the 145 pcm'
* solve the neutronics in -> solve the neutronics equations in
* Remove pcm numbers from the intro
* Present pin-wise reaction rates

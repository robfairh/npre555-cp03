The mutigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results for complex fuel assemblies or pin-by-pin mesh applications.


brantley_simplifiedP3_2000:

The SP N approximation has the advantages that there are fewer equations than with the full PN approximation.

I believe the motivation is to give the SPN method a stronger theoretical basis.


beckert_development_2007:

Loading cores with higher content of MOX fuel, the increase of the fuel cycle length, and the consideration of new reactor types are challenging for the diffusion method.

The SP3 method was developed to improve the accuracy of the DYN3D code.


ryu_finite_2013:

The simplified P 3 (SP 3) equations (Gelbard, 1962; Brantley and Larsen, 2000) can provide considerable accuracy improvement over the diffusion equation without requiring significant additional computational overhead or coding changes.




Motivation for multi-physics calculations:

Multi-physics simulations are necessary for assessing the safety characteristics of a reactor \cite{fairhurst-agosta_multi-physics_2020}.
Solving the neutronics equations provides information on the power distribution, which plays a crucial role in the thermal-fluids behavior of the reactor.
Therefore, the right modeling of the neutron flux is necessary.
While different methods for solving the neutronics are available in the open literature, we will focus on the $SP_3$ equations.

The $P_N$ method \cite{davidson_neutron_1957} discretizes the transport equation by expanding the angular dependence of the neutron flux in spherical harmonics, considering only up to order $N$ polynomials.


If $N \rightarrow \infty$, the solution tends to the exact transport solution.
In three-dimensional geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations grows like $(N+1)^2$.
In one-dimensional Cartesian geometries, the number of $P_N$ equations in $(N+1)$.


Gelbard proposed the $SP_N$ approximation by replacing the second derivatives in the one-dimensional Cartesian $P_N$ equations with three-dimensional Laplacian operators.

The $SP_N$ approximation considerably reduces the number of equations conserving a reasonable accuracy.

The disadvantages of the $SP_N$ approximation is that the solution does not usually converge to the true transport solution as $N \rightarrow \infty$.


Numerical results consistently show that the $SP_N$ approximation yields more accurate solutions than the diffusion approximation with considerably less computational expense than the discrete ordinates ($S_N$) approximation.

Several studies reported an increased accuracy over the diffusion method.
cite 6,7,8,9,10,11,12

13, 14, 15 provided the first theoretical basis for the accuracy of the SPN equations in multi-dimensional applications.
They showed that these equations are higher-order asymptotic solutions of the transport equation in a physical regime in which diffusion theory is the leading-order approximation.....

Two problems:
* pseudo-one dimensional
* modification of the OECD/NEACRP-L-336 C5 MOX fuel benchmark \cite{cavarec_benchmark_1994}


If the multidimensional transport solution behaves in a locally one-dimensional manner at each point r in space, then the SP3 solution reduces to P3 without approximation.


SP3 boundary conditions:
We assume that the outer and internal boundary surfaces are nearly one-dimensional in the sense that tangential derivatives of the auxiliary functions on these surfaces are O(\delta) quantities.
This assumption is true at an outer vaccuum boundary if the boundary is smooth with small curvature.
It is also often true at a nearly-planar interior boundary between two regions with strongly differing material properties.
This assumption may not be valid at a geometrically complicated interior material interface of at an interior interface between teo regions with weakly differing material properties.


Literature on the computation efficiency of SP_N calculations versus diffusion, P_N, and S_N calculations.
7,8,10 - 15,22,24

The results show that otaining the SPN solutions takes 2 or 3 times as compared with diffusion calculations, and a fraction of the time required by S_N or P_N calculations.


OECD/NEACRP-L-336 C5 MOX fuel benchmark:
The C5 benchmark was designed to compare different techniques of fine flux prediction from coarse-mesh diffusion and transport calculations.

Definition of the problem in Fig 6.
Relative errors in power distribution uses the symmetry line on the diagonal.


We next consider the application of the diffusion, simplified P3 approximations to problems with mixed-oxide fuels.

Mixed-oxide fuel assemblies possess significantly different neutronic properties than UO 2 fuel assemblies.
Namely, the thermal absorption and fission cross sections in MOX assemblies are much higher than in UO 2 assemblies.
As a result, the thermal flux is much lower in the MOX assemblies as compared with the UO 2 assemblies, but the power production is much higher.
The stronger absorption in MOX assemblies and the large cross-section discontinuities at MOX-UO2 assembly interfaces can be challenging for the diffusion approximation.

When no anisotropic component of the scattering cross section is available the 'diagonal transport correction' is used to compensate the lack of data for the scattering anisotropy (p. 37)

Motivation:
The mutigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results for complex fuel assemblies or pin-by-pin mesh applications.

The SP_N approximation replaces the second derivatives in the one-dimensional Cartesian geometry P_N equations by the three-dimensional Laplacian operator avoiding the complexity of the full spherical harmonics approximation.

Brantley and Larsen \cite{brantley_simplifiedP3_2000} provided a theoretical basis for the accuracy of the SPN equations.
% not sure this is entirely true, see brantley_simplifiedP3_2000

This approximation is cheap from the computational point of view and it has been succesfully used to improve the diffusion solution in MOX reactors \cite{beckert_development_2007}.

Nevertheless, the best solution from the theoretical point of view, is obtained from the P L approximation.
They seem to be solving P3, and not SP3 ...
Apparently, Fletcher. The Solution of the Multigroup Neutron Transport Equation Using Spherical Harmonics. 1982. is a good paper about P_L methods.

Two cases:
* C5 MOX benchmark presented in Cavarec et al. 1994.

* MOX/UO2 benchmark reactor geometry defined by Brantley and Larsen \cite{brantley_simplifiedP3_2000}

C5 MOX Benchmark:

dimensions of each assembly: 21.42 x 21.42 cm
17 x 17 assembly: squared pin cells 1.26 cm

Keff: heterogeneous and homogeneous system
Also core power distribution.

The results were obtained using the cross-sections and corrective factors from Table 2 (what I did seems correct).

DYN3D:
* 3D steady state and transients
* Square or hexagonal fuel assemblies
* Based on nodal methods
* Two-group neutron diffusion equation

* pinwise calculations of the steady-state of the OECD/NEA and US NRC PWR MOX/UO2 Core Transient Benchmark.
* 16-group cross section library for DORT with homogenized pin cells.
* Using the transport croo-section for the calculation of the diffusion coefficient gives much better results that those obtained with the removal cross-section.
* Results compared with the DORT and a reference solution for the heterogeneous problem obtained with DeCART.
* DORT = Discrete Ordinates transport code
* DeCART = Method of Characteristics

* Motivation: UO2/MOX reactors require more accurate methods
	- more energy groups
	- transport approximations superior to diffusion theory
	- consider more heterogenous models

* the SP3 method can be calculated from the removal cross-section or from the transport cross-section
* diffusion approximaiton makes \Sigma_1 = \Sigma_0 * mu_ave
* then, D1 = 1/3/(\sigma_t - \Sigma_0 * mu_ave)

* Diffusion approximation:
	- Stamm'ler and Abbate (1983): it is a good approximation if there is weak absorption
	- Not accurate for situations involving large energy transfer and anisotropic scattering

* US NRC PWR MOX/UO_2 Core Transient Benchmark:
	- core height = 367.76 cm
	- MOX: 4., 4.3, Pu-fissile
	- UO2: 4.2% and 4.5%
	- HZP = 560 K
	- coolant density = 752.06 kg/m3
	- boron: 1000 ppm

* The results indicate that using the transport cross-section yields better results than using the removal cross-section.
* keff is closer and also the assembly power distribution

The theoretical underpinnings of the method were not fully understood until work done by Pomraning \cite{pomraning_asymptotic_1993}, Brantley, and Larsen \cite{brantley_simplifiedP3_2000}.

Currently, different software use the SP3 approximation to solve the neutron transport equation, such as SIMULATE-5 \cite{bahadir_studsviks_2009}, SCOPE2 \cite{tatsumi_object-oriented_2002}, DYN3D \cite{beckert_development_2007}, and PARCS \cite{downar_parcs_2004}.

PARCS:
------

It should be noted that the general SP N equations are asymptotic corrections to the P 1 theory.
For planar geometry problems, these corrections exactly reduce to the P N equations.
In practice, the SP N equations are most accurate for problems that are reasonably close to being diffusive in nature or for problems that have strong transport regions in which the solution behaves nearly one-dimensionally and has weak tangential derivatives at material interfaces.
However, for problems that have strong multidimensional transport effects, such as voids, streaming regions, or geometically complex spatial inhomogeneous, the SP N solutions are less accurate

Chao \cite{chao_new_2017} proposed a generalized SPN formulation including a generic case of multi-group anisotropic neutron source with improved boundary conditions.

Analytic coarse mesh finite difference first introduced by Chao (find reference)
This paper uses the ACMFD methology for the solution of static SP3 equations.
Solver called SIMANOD.
They developed as well a diffusion solver based on the ACMFD method (DIFANOD) to compare their accuracies.

Part II will extend to transient problems.

Equations use the transport cross-section.
Equations taken from PARCS.

* Test case 1: Cube, comparison against MCNP and DIFANOD.
* Test case 2: C5G2, comparison against MCNP and DIFANOD.
* Test case 3: IAEA-3D, comparison against DANTSYS(S16) and DIFANOD.
* Test case 4: Takeda's small fast breeder reactor, comparison against McCARD (values from ryu_finite_2013) and DIFANOD.


Notes:
------
* not sure if using the removal cross-section is better or not than the transport cross-section.
* C5 MOX Benchmark indicates that it should use the transport cross-section if I don't have the information of the higher scattering moments.
* Maybe carry out C5 MOX Benchmark in Serpent ?

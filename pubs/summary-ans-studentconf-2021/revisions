Done

* Remove 'the' from 'within the 145 pcm'
* solve the neutronics in -> solve the neutronics equations in
* Remove pcm numbers from the intro
* Present pin-wise reaction rates
* Motivate SP3 implementation a little more strongly

Kind of done:

* Clarify that the method only solves SPN for N=3 --> I think this is clear... the title says SP3, not SPN
* Re-order introduction to improve the flow of ideas

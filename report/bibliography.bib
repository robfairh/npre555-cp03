	abstract = {For the analysis of reactors with complex fuel assemblies or ﬁne mesh applications as pin by pin neutron ﬂux reconstruction, the usual approximation of the neutron transport equation by the multigroup diffusion equation does not provide good results. A classical approach to solve the neutron transport equation is to apply the spherical harmonics method obtaining a ﬁnite approximation known as the PL equations. In this line, a nodal collocation method for the discretization of these equations on a rectangular mesh is used in this paper to analyse reactors with MOX fuel assemblies. Although the 3D PL nodal collocation method becomes feasible due to the improvements in computer hardware, a complete treatment of the detailed structure of the fuel assemblies in actual three-dimensional geometry is still prohibitive, thus, an assembly homogenization method is necessary. A homogenization method compatible with our multidimensional PL code is proposed and tested performing heterogeneous and homogenized calculations. In this work, we apply the method to 2D complex fuel assembly conﬁgurations.},

	abstract = {Moltres is a new physics application for modeling coupled physics in ﬂuid-fuelled, molten salt reactors. This paper describes its neutronics model, thermal hydraulics model, and their coupling in the MOOSE framework. Neutron and precursor equations are implemented using an action system that allows use of an arbitrary number of groups with no change in the input card. Results for many-channel conﬁgurations in 2D-axisymmetric and 3D coordinates are presented and compared against other coupled models as well as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment.},
